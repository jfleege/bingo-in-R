# Bingo in R! 
This game will eventually be fully functional. As of now, I currently have implemented a high score feature. The only other thing that I plan on adding to the game is a tracker that detects how far a user is away from a bingo because it's not so apparent in the R console.



## How It's Made:
Tech used: R

This project first started from a class I took at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, STAT 385, which was/is titled Statistical Programming Methods. The "final" for the course required us to make our own game in R, taking tools that we learned throughout the course and commanded us to use them. When thinking about a game to make, I decided that Bingo would be a somewhat decent challenge to test my coding capabilities for my first independent coding project. Stepping through the progress, I first developed the player card and number pool system; making sure to start out with the basics. As I found my footing, I grew more comfortable testing my skills as I eventually incuded more and more features.


## Optimizations and Features

- a 1 or 2 player option
- option to play more than one game
- move tracker
- high score tracker

### **looking to add moves till bigno feature


## Lessons Learned:
The biggest lesson I learned with this project is to make sure that I give myself time. Whether it means taking the time to make sure my code runs, or actually spending time away from the code itself to make sure my ideas remain fresh, I must allow myself some grace.
