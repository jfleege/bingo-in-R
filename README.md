# Bingo in R! 
After finshing the bingo detector, I believe I am finished implementing my game. Feel free to implement any new optimizations or features as needed.



## How It's Made:
Tech used: R

This project began with a class I took at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, STAT 385, which was/is titled Statistical Programming Methods. The "final" for the course required us to create our own game in R, utilizing the tools we had learned throughout the course. When thinking about a game to make, I decided that Bingo would be a decent challenge to test my coding capabilities for my first independent coding project. Stepping through the process, I first developed the player card and number pool system, making sure to start with the basics. As I found my footing, I grew more comfortable testing my skills, eventually incorporating more and more features.


## Optimizations and Features

- a one or two-player option
- option to play more than one game
- move tracker
- high score tracker
- bingo detector


## Lessons Learned:
The biggest lesson I learned from this project is to make sure that I give myself time. Whether it means taking the time to make sure my code runs or spending time away from the code itself to make sure my ideas remain fresh, I must allow myself some grace.
